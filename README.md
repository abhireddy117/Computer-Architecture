**Part 1: Simple Calculator in Assembly**
- Implements a simple calculator in assembly language, prompting the user to enter two integers and an operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication). It performs the operation and displays the result.
- Uses system calls for printing strings, reading numbers, printing integers, and closing the program. Registers $v0, $a0, $s0-$s3 are utilized.
**Part 2: Array Operations in Assembly**
- Defines an array with 10 elements in the data segment and provides functions to find the maximum value and calculate the summation of the array. Outputs the results to the user.
- The array's address used by the simulator is 0x10010000
